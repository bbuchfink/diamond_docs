# Installation & requirements

DIAMOND compiles as generic C++ code and has no particular requirements
on the hardware architecture, but it makes use of the SSE instruction
set of the Intel/AMD x86-64 platform if available and will run
considerably faster on that platform. It runs on POSIX-compatible
operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, OS X) as well as on Microsoft
Windows.

A high-memory server is recommended for better performance, but the
program can be run on standard desktop computers or laptops.

Compiled binaries are available for download for Linux, macOS (via
Bioconda), FreeBSD (via `pkg`) and Windows. For best performance, it is
recommended to compile the software from source on the target system.

## Binary download

### Linux

A precompiled binary is available for recent Linux systems and may be
downloaded for immediate use:

    wget http://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/releases/download/v0.9.30/diamond-linux64.tar.gz
    tar xzf diamond-linux64.tar.gz

If the binary does not work on your system, i.e. you are getting error
messages like `Kernel too old`, please try another installation method
or compile the software from source.

### Linux/macOS (via Bioconda)

Install [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) on your system if not
already present, then install DIAMOND using this shell command:

    conda install -c bioconda diamond

Regularly updating to the latest version is also recommended:

    conda update diamond

### Linux (via Docker)

To pull the latest version of the official Docker container:

    docker pull buchfink/diamond

To pull a specific version:

    docker pull buchfink/diamond:version0.9.30

### FreeBSD

On FreeBSD, you can use `pkg install diamond` to install the software.

### Windows

A binary executable for Windows can be downloaded at the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/releases)
page. You also need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

## Compiling from source

Compilation requires GCC 4.8.1 or later, CMake 2.6 or later as well as
`libpthread` and `zlib` including development headers. To compile DIAMOND
from source, invoke the following commands on the shell:

    wget http://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/archive/v0.9.30.tar.gz
    tar xzf v0.9.30.tar.gz
    cd diamond-0.9.30
    mkdir bin
    cd bin
    cmake ..
    make install

Note:

  - Use ` cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=...  ` to install to a different
    prefix.

  - Use `cmake -DBUILD_STATIC=ON` to create a statically linked
    executable.
  - Use `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_MARCH=native` to perform a native compile.
